"""Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in 
the grid.
The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent 
cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used 
more than once.
Example 1: Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = 
"ABCCED"
Output: true
Example 2: Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = 
"SEE"
Output: true
Example 3: Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = 
"ABCB"
Output: false"""
